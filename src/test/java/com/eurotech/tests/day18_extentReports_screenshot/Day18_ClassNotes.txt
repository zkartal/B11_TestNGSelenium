Day18_ClassNotes TestNG Extent Report | Screenshot

	Why do we need to report ?
		To collect the test results.
		To send the results to related people/business side.

	Why is the report important ?
		The business side does NOT see your code or test framework.
		They probably don’t understand.
		They will follow your test work with your report.

	What should be in the report ?
		Test name, Tester name, Browser, Test Steps (Admin/User), Test Data, Date and Time,
		Operating System, Result, if it is failed we need to understand why it is failed.

	HTML reporting
		A good bug report must have;
			1. Definition
			2. Bug Reproduce Steps
			3. Expected and Actual Results
			4. Test Data
			5. Screenshot/Evidence and exception

		We will setup only once and each time we will use it with all test cases
			Like —> TestBase, before method etc.

		Where should be the result in the framework ?
			In a folder inside the project

		We need report tool (TestNG report)
			mvnrepository (Individually) but normally Company will provide

		How can we add tool or library in the framework ?
			pom.xml file --> If you want to add some features to your framework you need to find its dependency
			maven repository --> Where we can find the library

		When we use testNG/Junit with selenium, we can use reporting tools such as Allure and ExtentReports.
			go to —> https://mvnrepository.com/
			write in to searchbox —> ExtentReports
			choose —> ExtentReports→  com.aventstack » extentreports
			choose —> 4.0.9 (Stable version)
			take dependency under maven and
			go to project pom.xml
			past inside the —> dependencies
			update maven
